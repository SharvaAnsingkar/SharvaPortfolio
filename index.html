									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/PicEDAI2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p><b>(RESEARCH PAPER PUBLISHED AND AWARDED BEST RESEARCH PAPER AWARD IN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AIML HELD AT VIGNAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, HYDERABAD, TELANGANA, INDIA)</b>.<br>This project aims to reduce traffic congestion by dynamically adjusting red traffic signal durations based on real-time traffic data. By analyzing vehicle volumes on weekdays and weekends, the system tailors signal timings to optimize traffic flow, reducing wait times and congestion. Additionally, strategically placed sensors detect approaching vehicles, sending alerts to traffic authorities when no movement is detected, signaling potential blockages. This proactive approach allows for quick route diversions, preventing further buildup. The automation of these processes ensures a responsive, efficient traffic management system without manual intervention.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Solspot:<br />
											Efficient Parallel Parking</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/EDAISEM3pt2.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project introduces a smart and efficient solution to tackle parking challenges in congested areas. Utilizing components such as a solar panel, ESP32 microcontroller, L298N motor driver, and UBEC, the system enables precise control of vehicle movement in all directions—forward, backward, left, and right. With Wi-Fi connectivity, users can seamlessly control the car, enhancing maneuverability and enabling smooth parallel parking. By integrating technology-driven solutions, this project reduces parking time and provides a foundation for advanced parking systems, aligning with ongoing innovations like 360-degree turning vehicles and automated parking systems.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">AutoValue<br />
											Car Resale Price Prediction System</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/PicDS.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>A machine learning-based system to predict car resale values using features like make, model, mileage, year, fuel type, and prior usage. Advanced data preprocessing handles missing values, normalizes features, and encodes categorical data. Multiple regression models—including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods—are explored and optimized. Validated on real-world data, the system ensures high accuracy and generalizability, supporting efficient pricing and decision-making in the used car market.
